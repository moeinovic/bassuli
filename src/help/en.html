Are you suffering from hemorrhoids? Try our virtual treatment program! Use the /shrink command once a day in every chat you're in to try to reduce your hemorrhoid protrusion. Compete with friends to have the smallest measurement possible!

The treatment range for the command is between <b>{grow_min}</b> and <b>{grow_max}</b> cm. Use the /top command to show players with the smallest hemorrhoids, or /worst to see who has the most severe condition.

Also, there is a daily selection of <i>the Hemorrhoid of the Day</i> in every chat. This title brings its owner some bonus improvement with additional centimeters of shrinkage. Only active patients who have attempted treatment at least once in the last week participate in the selection.

If you want to challenge your friends and are ready for some risk, you may participate in an Anal Penetration Battle! Just place a bet via /penetrate or /buttfight command. The winner will improve their condition by the specified amount of centimeters. The loser's condition will worsen. Use /clench to try to reduce potential damage!

<b>Wait, I already played similar health simulation games in Telegram...</b>

This bot has been created as a parody of various "growing" games in Telegram, with a humorous medical twist. We promise not to send advertising messages in your chat groups!

Using the /import command, sent as a reply to a message from another bot, describing positions of the users in its top, any administrator of a chat may import hemorrhoid data from other similar bots. Currently, the following bots are supported: {other_bots}.

For import to be done successfully, a patient must already have a hemorrhoid in this bot! The bot must be granted temporary administrator privileges to be able to read the message of the other bot. This allows us to keep the privacy mode enabled, preventing even theoretical possibility for the bot to read all messages in the chat.

<b>The administrator of the chat doesn't allow to add unknown bots</b>

There is a way to play without the bot being in a chat at all! Just use inline queries! Type the username of the bot after the <code>@</code> sign and a trailing space to get the same commands!

<b>Contacts and links</b>

In case of any problems, write to {admin_chat_en} or create an issue in the source code repository.

The source code of the bot, written in Rust, is available on GitHub under a bit modified MIT license: {git_repo}

<b>For those with severely swollen hemorrhoids</b>

1️⃣ your every treatment will be improved by <b>{help_pussies_percentage}%</b> of the "excess";
2️⃣ as an alternative option, use the /loan command to get a hemorrhoid treatment on credit, which will be gradually paid out by each subsequent shrinkage treatment.
